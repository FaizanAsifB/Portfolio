        "An interactive multiplayer game with real-time functionality that operates on a simple premise, each round, a random alphabet is chosen, and players must provide answers for various categories starting with that letter.",
        "The game offers two modes, each determining how rounds are concluded. In the first mode, rounds conclude when the timer reaches zero, while in the second mode, the timer resets to 10 seconds upon the first player's submission of their answers.",
        "Players earn points based on the uniqueness of their answers, with 10 points awarded for unique responses, 5 points for duplicates, and 0 points for incorrect or missing answers. The game continues through multiple rounds, and the player with the highest score at the end of the final round wins."
